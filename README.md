# A neuro-fuzzy approach for classifier selection in credit scoring

Credit risk is a part of financial risk and its assessment is the most important decision for financial institute prosperity, so in literature plenty of credit scoring theories were introduced. A cooperative Neuro-Fuzzy model is proposed for clients’ classification between solvents and insolvents. In a phase, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) produces evaluation metric scores for 3 ANN topologies (1, 2, 3 Hidden Layer ANN) using 4 tuning hyperparameter techniques, and in a parallel phase evaluation metrics hierarchy are derived from expert’s view via Fuzzy AHP model. Combining two phases, a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model provides the optimal neural network topology. The proposed method innovation lies on intervention of financial expert’s aspect and institute’s policy in a data-driven model without output reasoning, with an upper aim to manipulate the tremendous force of Neural Networks. In this paper, suggested model was applied on 3 datasets and its results were discussed in order to reveal its utility. The conclusion lies on the fact that human opinion through Fuzzy AHP, is crucial when ANN models generate similar performance metric outputs and generally, it could be used as a validation manner on decisions based on ANN outputs.
